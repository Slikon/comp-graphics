# Computer Graphics

## Lab1: Bezier Curves
Draw a Shark contour with the help of 5th order BÃ©zier curves. Includes contour extraction from image, point simplification, and visualization of both original and simplified Bezier curve representations.

## Lab2: 3D Surface Generation
Implementation of a "Moon" surface (Variant 5) with interactive controls. Features include:
- 3D parametric surface generation with mathematical transformations
- Mapping 2D shark contour onto the 3D surface
- Real-time manipulation with rotation, translation and contour mapping controls

## Lab3: Fractals
Implementation of three different types of fractals:
- L-System Fractal: Hexagonal Mosaic using string rewriting and turtle graphics
- IFS Fractal: Barnsley Fern using Iterated Function Systems with probabilistic transformations
- Algebraic Fractal: Mandelbrot Set using complex number iteration and escape time algorithm
